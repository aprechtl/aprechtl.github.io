<h1>Barksanot Audio Guide</h1>

<p>Barksanot produces very high frequency beeps in order to discourage dogs from barking. For best results, you'll need to plug your device into an external audio amplifier and speakers, preferably tweeters or speaker boxes with tweeters inside. A portable Bluetooth speaker might work indoors or at short ranges, but a purpose designed audio system will be more effective in most cases.</p>

<h3>Amplifier</h3>

<p>Power amplifiers are getting less and less expensive, plus they're easy to find on the used market. Just try searching the classifieds or your preferred electronics store for "power amplifier" or "audio amplifier". The power rating you'll need will depend on your specific application, but here's an estimate:
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Watts</td>
    <td>Application</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Close quarters indoors</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10–25</td>
    <td>Normal indoors</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25–100</td>
    <td>Outdoors up to 50 feet away</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100+</td>
    <td>Outdoors over 50 feet away</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Make sure you're looking at continuous or "RMS" wattage, rather than peak wattage.
Also note that it's good practice to oversize your amplifier so that you aren't constantly running it at its maximum power.</p>

<p>You can find all sorts of amplifiers that will be up to the task, including hi-fi, DJ, pro audio (PA), and commercial amplifiers—most any except for ones that color the sound, such as guitar or bass amplifiers. Just make sure it has the desired power rating and that it can support your speaker impedance (see below).

<h3>Speakers</h3>

<p>You can use regular hi-fi speakers if they have tweeters built in, or you can simply buy a set of tweeters and mount them in a manner suitable to your application. You can find tweeters that will do the job for a very low cost, typically around $10–15 a pair in the US. Take note of the following specs:
<ul>
    <li><i>Power rating (watts)</i>: The total number of watts the speaker can handle. Make sure the amp does not overload the speakers by pushing them too hard. The simplest way to do this is to ensure your speakers can handle more watts than the amp can provide. If the amplifier is rated higher, you can still use it as long as you don't turn it up too loud; however, it's not obvious how loud is too loud until it's too late. Also, as with the amplifier, you'll want to pay attention to continuous or "RMS" watts, not peak.</li>
    <li><i>Impedance (ohms)</i>: The impedance of the speaker/tweeter should match one of the values listed in the amplifier specifications. Note that you can double up speakers in order to double or halve their individual impedance by wiring them in series or parallel, respectively. Doing so will also double the amount of power that can be handled. For example, if your amplifier is rated for 100 watts into 8 ohms, and you have two 4 ohm, 50 watt tweeters, you can wire the tweeters in series in order to reach 8 ohms and be able to handle the full 100 watts.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Speaker Placement</h3>

<p>Position the speakers as close to the dog as possible, facing it without obstructions. Walls, fences, and even tree leaves can block high frequencies, so a clear line of sight is important.</p>

<p>As the effects of ultrasonic frequencies on humans are not well understood, <b>do not point the speakers towards any humans.</b></p>

<p>There are various ways to waterproof your system for outdoor use. You can purchase waterproof tweeters, but they are much more expensive than regular tweeters. With regular tweeters, you can put them in a small enclosure or even birdhouse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUx3tWnmZvs">This video</a> shows an inexpensive method that uses ABS pipes to keep rain off the tweeters.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that long wires between the amp and speakers can absorb some of the signal and reduce the total output wattage. Within reason, you can get around this by purchasing thicker wire. <a href="https://www.systoncable.com/choosing-wire-gauge-ofc-audio-speaker-wire/">Here</a> is a guide to choosing speaker wire. You can alternatively use extension cords if you are handy with wiring.</p>

<h3>Microphone Placement</h3>

<p>The closer the microphone is to the dog, the easier it will be for Barksanot to distinguish barks from other noises. Thus, the closer you can get the microphone to the dog, the better. However, do bear in mind that wind can be an issue outdoors.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can purchase an inexpensive lavalier mic to plug into your device. With foam filters they will be able to reject wind noise better tan your built-in microphone, and can be placed closer to the dog while allowing your device to remain plugged in.</p>
